This package is currently under development. It will provide
functionality to access and manage the application programming interface
(API) of the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program
(UCDP)](https://www.ucdp.uu.se/). Intended functions are `ucdp.yearly()`
and `ucdp.ged()`, enabling retrieval of yearly data and geo-coded event
data.

When using a UCDP dataset, make sure to cite its authors as indicated on
the [UCDP download page](https://www.ucdp.uu.se/downloads/).
